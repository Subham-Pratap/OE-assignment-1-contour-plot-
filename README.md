Optimisation Engineering assignment 1

Problem:   Write a python code that defines a linear function f(x1, x2) and returns a contour plot of f(x1, x2) at different levels.
           For example if the user input is f(x1,x2) = 5x1 + 4x2, then the python function should return a contour plot (see the attached file) as output.
